# About
This is a handy tool for all those burger lovers that want to keep track of the burgers they have eaten and plan to eat. Users will be able to update and delete burgers they have already eaten. The list can be as big as the users appetite.
## Installation
Users will navigate to the deployed link and enter burgers that they have either tried or that they want to try. Then they will be able to mark burgers as already had by clicking the devour burger icon. Users can delet burgers that have already been had but why not see how long the list can be!
## Usage
with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM this app is hosted on Heroku and github
## Test Instructions
It does accept junk values at the moment so in the v2 we will address that. I also want to play with the styling a bit more and really draw into the 'royal' theme of the app.
